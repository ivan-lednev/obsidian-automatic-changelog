## Purpose

This plugin lets you render Git diff output in your notes.

I personally use it in a combo with obsidian-git to revise what I've been working on a given day, like an automatic
changelog, but you can point it to any repo in your file system.

## Usage

The plugin renders Markdown code blocks with the `show-diff` language tag.

An empty code block will show a diff between today and yesterday:

<pre>
```show-diff
```
</pre>

### `dates`

With `dates` you can specify a date range to show changes for:
<pre>
```show-diff
dates:
  from: 2021-01-01
  to: 2021-01-02
```
</pre>

### `commits`

With `commits` you can specify a commit range to show changes for:
<pre>
```show-diff
commits:
  from: HEAD^
  to: HEAD
```
</pre>

### `path`

This defaults to obsidian, but you can point the plugin to any repository in your file system:
<pre>
```show-diff
path: /path/to/my-pet-project
```
</pre>

### `exclude`

`.obsidian` (Obsidian's settings & cache) is excluded by default. You can override this with a single path:
<pre>
```show-diff
exclude: trash
```
</pre>

or with a list of paths:
<pre>
```show-diff
exclude:
  - trash
  - archive
  - .obsidian
```
</pre>

### Command: Generate diff code block for today

The plugin provides a command to quickly insert in a note a code block like this:
<pre>
```show-diff
dates:
  from: 2023-04-23
  to: 2023-04-24
```
</pre>
